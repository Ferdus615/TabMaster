      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: July 26, 2025</p>

      <p>
        Your privacy is of utmost importance to TabMaster. This Privacy Policy
        explains how TabMaster ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and
        protects your information when you use our website, browser extension,
        and services (collectively, the "Service").
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> When you use TabMaster, we
        may collect non-personal information about your usage, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Browser Data:</strong> Information about your browser type,
          version, and operating system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage Data:</strong> Aggregated and anonymized data on how you
          interact with the extension, such as features used, frequency of use,
          and general patterns of tab management. This data is used solely to
          improve our Service and understand user behavior in aggregate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical Data:</strong> Limited technical information about
          your device and network that does not identify you personally.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>No Personal Information (Directly):</strong> TabMaster does not
        directly collect personal identifying information such as your name,
        email address, IP address, specific Browse history (beyond what is
        necessary for the extension's functionality, which is stored locally),
        or payment details.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Locally Stored Data:</strong> All information related to your
        tabs, groups, and saved sessions is processed and stored locally within
        your browser's storage. This data is not transmitted to our servers or
        any third parties unless explicitly enabled by you for features like
        cloud syncing (if offered, with clear consent).
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use the non-personal and locally stored information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, operate, and maintain our Service.</li>
        <li>Improve and optimize the functionality of TabMaster.</li>
        <li>Develop new features and enhancements.</li>
        <li>
          Analyze usage patterns to understand how users interact with the
          Service (in aggregate).
        </li>
        <li>Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        TabMaster does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your non-personal
        information or locally stored data to outside parties without your
        explicit consent, except in the following limited circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share anonymized,
          aggregated usage data with trusted third-party service providers who
          assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or
          providing services to you, provided that these parties agree to keep
          this information confidential and use it only for the purposes for
          which we disclose it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information
          if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public
          authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency request).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protection of Rights:</strong> We may disclose information
          when we believe it is appropriate to protect the rights, property, or
          safety of TabMaster, our users, or others.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable security measures to protect your non-personal
        and locally stored data from unauthorized access, alteration,
        disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the
        Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive
        to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we
        cannot guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Links</h2>
      <p>
        Our website or Service may contain links to third-party websites or
        services that are not owned or controlled by TabMaster. We have no
        control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy
        policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. We
        strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you
        visit.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        TabMaster is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do
        not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
        under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your
        child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. If
        we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child
        under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to
        remove that information from our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and
        updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. You are advised to review
        this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this
